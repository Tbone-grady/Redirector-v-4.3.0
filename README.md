# Redirector-v-4.3.0

inserts local iptables rules to forward traffic to a user process
and instantiates this user process (redirector), which is
a local encryptor/decryptor/redirector

load up on a server add more perl scripts that target system vulnerabilities and set up for redirecting traffic from tor, firefox, IE explorer, etc. to infect devices and leave an almost zero percent virtual footprint. 

Use a empty domain name with the server and youll be happy with exploiting systems without breaking a sweat.

FUCK YOU SCRIPT KIDDIES!!!!
